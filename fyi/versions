      Fixes for constructor declarations (#89)
      
      Constructor declarations can have the same decl-specifiers as
      constructor definitions. This adds a new rule to match as many
      "constructor specifiers" that are present in any order before the
      function decl itself, and adds the rule to constructor declarations and
      constructor definitions.
      
      The cast operator can also have any of these specifiers in any order
      before the declaration, so this commit also changes the cast operator
      declaration and definition to use the new rule as well.
      
      Finally, constructor declarations and cast operator declarations can be
      part of a template declaration in addition to the definitions, so add
      them both to the template_declaration rule.
